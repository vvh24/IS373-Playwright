<h1>Playwright and Hexo Documentation</h1>

    <h2>1. What is Playwright?</h2>
        Playwright is a tool that automates web browsers. This means it can open a website, interact with it (like clicking on buttons, filling out forms), take screenshots, and verify if certain text appears on the page.
    With Playwright, you can automate repetitive tasks and test your website without manually doing it. This saves time and ensures that your website behaves correctly every time you make changes.

    <h2>2. How to Set Up Playwright</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Install Node.js</h3>
        Before setting up Playwright, you need to have Node.js installed. Download it from <a href="https://nodejs.org/">here</a>

    <h3>Step 2: Create a Folder for Playwright</h3>
<code>
mkdir my-playwright-tests
cd my-playwright-tests
</code>

    <h3>Step 3: Install Playwright</h3>
        Inside the folder, install Playwright by running these commands:
<code>
npm init -y  # Initialize a Node.js project
npm install playwright  # Install Playwright
</code>

    <h2>3. How Playwright Works</h2>
        Playwright allows you to control a browser using JavaScript. You write scripts that tell the browser to do things like:
    <ul>
        <li>Open a website.</li>
        <li>Click on buttons or links.</li>
        <li>Take a screenshot of the page.</li>
        <li>Verify if text or an element exists on the page.</li>
    </ul>
        Here's a simple Playwright script:
<code>
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
    const browser = await chromium.launch();  // Launch the browser
    const page = await browser.newPage();  // Open a new tab
    await page.goto('http://example.com');  // Go to the website
    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshot.png' });  // Take a screenshot
    await browser.close();  // Close the browser
})();
</code>

        This script will open a browser, go to the website <code>http://example.com</code>, take a screenshot, and then close the browser.

    <h2>4. Why is Playwright Useful?</h2>
    Playwright is useful for automating tests on websites. Instead of manually checking if your website is working correctly, Playwright can automatically perform tests and tell you if something is broken.
        It's also helpful because it:
    <ul>
        <li>Saves time when testing websites.</li>
        <li>Can simulate real user actions (like clicking and filling forms).</li>
        <li>Works across multiple browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Important Keywords and Commands in Playwright</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Launch</strong>: Starts the browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>Goto</strong>: Navigates to a specific URL.</li>
        <li><strong>Click</strong>: Simulates a user clicking on an element.</li>
        <li><strong>Screenshot</strong>: Takes a screenshot of the page.</li>
        <li><strong>Close</strong>: Closes the browser when done.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. How Playwright Works with Different Applications and Systems</h2>
        Playwright can work with any web application or system that runs in a browser. It can:
    <ul>
        <li>Test different types of websites (blogs, stores, business apps).</li>
        <li>Run on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).</li>
        <li>Simulate user behavior on multiple browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. How Playwright Works with Hexo</h2>
        Hexo is a tool that generates static websites from markdown files. After you generate the website and run it locally using the command:
<code>hexo server</code>
    Playwright can then open the Hexo site (usually running on <code>http://localhost:4000</code>) and test it. For example, you can use Playwright to:
    <ul>
        <li>Check if your blog posts are loading correctly.</li>
        <li>Verify that links work.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the website layout is correct.</li>
    </ul>
        Hereâ€™s how Playwright can interact with a Hexo site:
<code>
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
    const browser = await chromium.launch();  // Launch the browser
    const page = await browser.newPage();  // Open a new tab
    await page.goto('http://localhost:4000');  // Visit the Hexo website
    await page.screenshot({ path: 'hexo-screenshot.png' });  // Take a screenshot of the Hexo site
    await browser.close();  // Close the browser
})();
</code>

    In this example, Playwright opens your Hexo site (running locally), takes a screenshot, and closes the browser.

    <h2>8. How Playwright Works on Your Computer</h2>
        Playwright runs through Node.js. When you run a Playwright script:
    <ol>
        <li><strong>You write a script</strong> that tells the browser what to do.</li>
        <li><strong>You run the script</strong> using Node.js (<code>node script.js</code>).</li>
        <li>Playwright <strong>opens the browser</strong> and follows the instructions in your script (e.g., visit a website, take a screenshot).</li>
        <li><strong>Playwright closes the browser</strong> once all the tasks are done.</li>
    </ol>

        Playwright uses "headless browsers" by default (which means no graphical interface), but you can also run it with real browsers (like the ones you normally use).
